    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      Science may conquer the stars, but it does nothing by jumps. As a
      Scientist, as well as a philosopher, I am accustomed to reaching the
      Transcendental by winding paths. It is characteristic of me that I should
      have consented to preface this remarkable Sonnet Cycle only after supreme
      deliberation, and that I should at last have determined to speak in behalf
      of the Car Conductor for the following reasons:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. As a Botanist I am fascinated by the phenomenon of Genius flourishing
      from bud to flower, from flower to seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. As a Psychologist I am anxious to establish once and for all, both by
      plano-inductive and precoordinate systems of logic, the Status of Slang.
    </p>
    <p>
      What position does Slang occupy in the thought of the world? Let us turn
      to Zoology for an answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      No traces of Slang may be found among mollusks, crustaceans or the lower
      invertebrates. Slang is not common to vertebrate fishes or to whales,
      seals, reptiles or anthropoid apes&mdash;in a word, slang-speaking is
      nowhere prevalent among lower animals. It may, then, be definitely and
      clearly asserted that Slang is the natural, logical expression of the
      Human Race. If Man, then, is the highest of created mammals, is not his
      natural speech (Slang) the highest of created languages? It is generally
      conceded that Literature is the most exalted expression of Language. Would
      not the Literature, then, which employs the highest of created languages
      (Slang) be the supreme Literature of the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      By such logical, irrefutable, inductive steps have I proven not only the
      Status of Slang, but the literary importance of these Sonnets which it is
      at once my scientific duty and my esthetic pleasure to introduce.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twenty-six exquisite Sonnets which form this Cycle were written,
      probably, during the years 1906 and 1907. Their author was William Henry
      Smith, a car conductor, who penned his passion, from time to time, on the
      back of transfer-slips which he treasured carefully in his hat (1). We
      have it from no less an authority than Professor Sznuysko that the Car
      Conductor usually performed these literary feats in public, writing
      between fares on the rear platform of a Sixth Avenue car. Smith's devotion
      to his Musa Sanctissima was often so hypnotic, I am told, that he
      neglected to let passengers on and off&mdash;nay, it is even held by some
      critics that he occasionally forgot to collect a fare. But be it said to
      his undying honor that his Employers never suffered from such
      carelessness, for it was the custom of our Poet to demand double fares
      from the old, the feeble and the mentally deficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as the illimitable ichor of star-dust, the mysterious Demiurge of the
      Universe, keeps the suns and planets to their orbitary revolutions, so
      must environment mark the Fas and Nefas of Genius. Plato's Idea of the
      Archetypal Man was due, perhaps, as much to the serene weather conditions
      of Academe as to the marvelous mentality of Plato. What had Job eaten for
      breakfast that he should have given utterance to his magnificent
      Lamentation? Was he the discoverer of Human Sorrow or the pioneer of Human
      Dyspepsia?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not altogether radical on my part, then, for me to assert that many
      of the stylistic peculiarities found in these Sonnets are attributable to
      the locale of their inspiration the rear platform of a Sixth Avenue car.
      One can plainly hear the jar and jounce of the elliptical wheels, the cry,
      "Step lively!" the six o'clock stampede, the lament of the strap-hanging
      multitude in such lines as these:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Three days with sad skidoo have came and went,
     Yet Pansy cometh nix to ride with me.
     I rubber vainly at the throng to see
     Her golden locks&mdash;gee! such a discontent!
     Perhaps she's beat it with some soapy gent&mdash;"
</pre>
    <p>
      Where are lines like these to be found in the Italian of Petrarch? Where
      has Tasso uttered an impassioned confession to resemble this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "But when I ogle Pansy in the throng
     My heart turns over twice and rings a gong"?
</pre>
    <p>
      Of the human or personal record of William Henry Smith very little has
      been discovered. Looking over the books of the Metropolitan Street Railway
      I unearthed the following entry:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nov. 1, 1907:"
    </p>
    <p>
      "W. H. Smith, conductor, discharged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remarks:&mdash;Car No. 21144, William Smith, conductor, ran into large
      brewery truck at So. E. cor. Sixth Ave. It is reported that Smith, to the
      neglect of his duty, was reading poetry from a book called 'Sonnets of de
      Heredia' at the time of the accident. Three Italians were slightly injured
      by the accident, and Ethelbert Pangwyn, an actor starring in 'The Girl and
      the Idiot,' a musical comedy, was killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smith was held for manslaughter, but Judge O' Rafferty, who had seen 'The
      Girl and the Idiot,' discharged the defendant, averring that the killing
      of Pangwyn did not constitute a crime."
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, has become of this minstrel who sang the Minnelieder of the
      Car-barns? Like Homer, like Omar, like Sappho, like Shakespeare, he is a
      Voice singing out of the mists. He was but a Name to his employers; and
      his friends, if he has friends, remember him not. These Sonnets, written
      neatly on twenty-six violet transfer-slips, were discovered, together with
      a rejection blank from a leading magazine, in the Dead Letter office.
      According to the current folk-lore in Harlem and the Bronx, Smith is now
      living in California employed as a brakeman on the Southern Pacific
      Railroad. Some aver that Pansy fell heiress to a sausage establishment and
      moved to Italy with her Poet. Still others maintain that Pansy, Gill the
      Grip and Maxy the Firebug never existed in real life&mdash;were merely the
      mind-children of a Symbolist and a dreamer of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the latter theory I incline at a scholarly angle. This Cycle may be
      taken, perhaps, not so much as a living record of human experience as a
      lofty parable sounding the key-note of all human life. Gill the Grip is
      the Iago, the Mefistofele, the symbolism of a malevolent destiny. Maxy the
      Firebug may be the Poet's interpretation of the Social Unrest, of Doubt,
      of progressive irresponsibility. Would it be going too far, then, to say
      that Pansy stands to us as the symbol of Pan-girlism&mdash;as an almost
      Anacreontic yearning for the type? Or may not these Sonnets be taken, in a
      way, as a modern Vita Nuova wherein a Sixth Avenue Alighieri calls to his
      Beatrice and mourns within when,
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pansy-girl refuses to occur?"
    </p>
    <p>
      So much for the Poet and his Purpose. Should any one of the readers of
      this Cycle doubt the enduring greatness of the lines, let him consider
      that I, Wolfgang Copernicus Addleburger, have seen fit to introduce them
      to immortality.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     (1) Since the salary-books of the Metropolitan Street
     Railways show, during the year 1906, 182 conductors named
     Smith in their employ, 38 of whom were named William Smith
     and 12 William Henry Smith, it is easy for the reader to
     conceive my task in establishing the identity of our Poet.

     The lemon-wagon rumbled by today
     And dropped me off a sour one&mdash;are you on?
     I went and gave the boss a cooney con
     About the Car-Barn Kick&mdash;what did he say?
     "Back to your platform, Clarence light and gay,
     Jingle the jocund fares, nor think upon
     The larks of Harry Lehr or Bath House John,
     For they are It and you are still on pay."

     So I have been sky-prancing all night long
     A-dragging car-conductors and their queens
     Clad in their laughing-robes to join the throng
     That makes the Car-Barn function all the beans.
     And say! I had a brainstorm just last trip
     When I took Pansy's fare from Gill the Grip.

     At Midnight when I got a gasp for lunch
     I mushed it for the Car-Barns just to lamp
     And see the Creamy Charlies do the vamp
     And swing their Fancy Floras in the crunch.
     I piped my Pansy in among the bunch
     And asked her would she mix it with the Champ,
     Wouldn't she like to join me in a stamp?
     She saw me first and stopped me with a punch.

     I saw her hook a loop with Gill the Grip,
     With Pinky Smith and Handsome Hank she heeled;
     With all the dossy bunks she took a skip
     Each time the German tune-professor spieled.

     I says, "To put it pleasant you're a screech,
     Your smile would shoo the seagulls off the beach,
     Your face would give Vesuvius a chill.
     You're just what Mr. Shakespeare calls 'a pill

     Now, if you want to answer with a speech,
     Open your trap at once, or else lie still."

     But when I handed Gill the Grip this cluster
     He simply clamped his language-mill down tight,
     Strangled his guff and acted rather fluster
     Although I'm sure I spoke to him polite.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
